    <h1>Privacy Policy for Whimsy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 2025-12-07</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Whimsy ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Audio Recordings</h3>
    <p>When you use voice features, audio is captured on your device and uploaded temporarily for processing. We do not store raw audio recordings on our servers beyond the time necessary to perform transcription (speech-to-text) and sentiment analysis.</p>
    <p>From uploaded audio we may retain derived data and metadata to provide and improve the service. Examples of retained derived data include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transcripts or text excerpts generated from your recordings</li>
        <li>Sentiment analysis results and related annotations</li>
        <li>Timestamps and usage metadata (e.g., which features were used and when)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Non-identifiable Technical Data</h3>
    <p>For security, abuse prevention, and basic analytics we may store limited non-identifiable technical information, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address (used solely for security, abuse detection, and rate-limiting)</li>
        <li>Approximate location at a city level only (not precise GPS coordinates)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Uploaded audio (processed into text) and derived metadata are used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide a sentiment-aware, gamified journaling experience</li>
        <li>Enable voice-based journaling and reflection by storing transcripts and analysis results (not raw audio)</li>
        <li>Improve app features over time using aggregated, de-identified insights</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent abuse or security incidents using limited technical data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Raw audio files are deleted from our servers after processing is complete. We may retain derived data (transcripts, sentiment scores, timestamps, and non-identifiable technical data) to improve the product and support features. Stored data is protected using industry-standard security practices (encryption in transit and at rest where applicable).</p>
    <p>Access to stored metadata is limited to authorized personnel and systems that need the data to operate or improve the service.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or trade your raw audio recordings. We may use and share aggregated or de-identified data (for example, anonymized usage statistics or aggregated sentiment trends) with partners for analytics, research, or product improvements. We will not share information that can reasonably be used to identify you without your explicit consent, except as required by law.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request deletion of your account and any stored derived metadata associated with it (transcripts, sentiment data, etc.) via the app or by contacting us</li>
        <li>Control which features have access to your microphone</li>
        <li>Request information about the data we hold about you</li>
        <li>Contact us with privacy-related questions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Raw audio is removed after processing. Derived metadata (transcripts, sentiment scores, timestamps, and non-identifiable technical data) are retained to improve the app and support features over time. If you request deletion of your account, we will remove personal data and stored metadata associated with your account in accordance with applicable law and our data retention procedures.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our app requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO):</strong> Required to capture voice input that is uploaded for transcription and sentiment analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save temporary or local copies of recordings on your device if needed; we do not persist raw audio to our servers beyond processing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us so we can promptly delete that information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
