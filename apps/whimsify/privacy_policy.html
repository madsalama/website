    <h1>Privacy Policy for Whimsify</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 2025-12-07</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Whimsy ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Audio Recordings</h3>
    <p>When you use voice features, audio is captured on your device and uploaded temporarily for processing. We do not store raw audio recordings on our servers beyond the time necessary to perform transcription (speech-to-text) and sentiment analysis. Transcripts of private journals and voice notes are not stored on our servers.</p>
    <p>If you choose to save entries locally on your device (for example, a local journal), those local copies remain on your device and are not uploaded or stored on our servers unless you explicitly choose to back them up.</p>

    <h3>Non-identifiable Technical Data</h3>
    <p>For security, abuse prevention, and basic analytics we may store limited non-identifiable technical information, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address (used solely for security, abuse detection, and rate-limiting)</li>
        <li>Approximate location at a city level only (not precise GPS coordinates)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Uploaded audio is processed to provide features like transcription and sentiment analysis. We do not retain transcripts of private journals or voice notes on our servers. We may keep short-lived processing logs temporarily to ensure reliable operation and to debug issues, but these do not contain full private journal content and are deleted according to our retention policies.</p>
    <p>We may also use aggregated, de-identified insights derived from usage (for example, overall sentiment trends across many users) to improve the app. Such aggregated data does not identify you or contain your private journal content.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Raw audio files and transcripts generated from private journals are deleted from our servers after processing is complete and are not stored. Local copies that you save on your device are controlled by you and remain on your device unless you choose to back them up to our servers.</p>
    <p>Stored technical data used for security and analytics is protected using industry-standard security practices (encryption in transit and at rest where applicable). Access to stored data is limited to authorized personnel and systems that need it to operate or improve the service.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or trade your private journal content or raw audio recordings. We may share aggregated or de-identified data (for example, anonymized usage statistics or overall sentiment trends) with partners for analytics, research, or product improvements. We will not share information that can reasonably be used to identify you or your private journal content without your explicit consent, except as required by law.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request deletion of your account and any stored non-identifiable data associated with it via the app or by contacting us</li>
        <li>Control which features have access to your microphone</li>
        <li>Request information about the data we hold about you</li>
        <li>Contact us with privacy-related questions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Raw audio and transcripts of private journals are removed after processing and are not retained on our servers. Short-lived processing logs and non-identifiable technical data used for security are retained only as long as necessary and deleted according to our retention procedures. Aggregated, de-identified insights may be retained to improve the product.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our app requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO):</strong> Required to capture voice input that is uploaded temporarily for processing</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save local copies of recordings or entries on your device if you choose to; local data is under your control and is not uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly back it up</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us so we can promptly delete that information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
